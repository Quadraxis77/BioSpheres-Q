# Genomes Folder

This folder is for storing your custom genome JSON files.

## Usage

- Save your genomes here to keep them organized
- The contents of this folder are git-ignored by default
- Share genomes by copying individual JSON files or creating a separate genome repository

## Folder Organization (Suggested)

You may want to organize your genomes into subfolders:

```
genomes/
├── experimental/     # Work-in-progress genomes
├── published/        # Finalized genomes ready to share
├── imported/         # Genomes from other users
└── archive/          # Old versions
```

## Sharing Genomes

To share genomes with others:
1. Copy the JSON file(s) you want to share
2. Upload to a file sharing service, GitHub gist, or separate repository
3. Others can download and place them in their `genomes/` folder

See `../GENOME_FORMAT.md` for details on the file format.
